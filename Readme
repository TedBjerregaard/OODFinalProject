About/ OverView
This Image Processor is designed to support JPEG PNG and PPM files
Operations on these files include Blur/Sharpen as well as Sepia/Grayscale
filters

Design/Model Changes
- we added a ComplexIPModel interface and class that retains the functionality
of the SimpleModel using a delegate.
- we needed to add a helper to the SimpleIP model (getCurrentImage)
- using a delegate allowed us to build off of our work from the previous homework,
adding functionality needed in the Complex Model

Assumptions
- User uses only supported file formats
- Base image must be added at Layer 0
- layers must be added in order starting at 0
- the Processor only conducts operations on the current
  Layer
